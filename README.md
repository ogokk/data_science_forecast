# A Multi-Model Approach for High-Resolution Wind Power Forecasting Using Lag Feature Engineering and Timestamp Encoding
Accurate forecasting of time-dependent variables is crucial in fields like healthcare, renewable energy, weather prediction, and many industrial operations. This study develops a time series forecasting framework to predict hourly wind power production, incorporating statistical analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning. The preprocessing steps include timestamp parsing, missing value handling, and extraction of time-based features like hour, day, weekday, and month, with timestamp (i.e. cyclical) encoding applied to preserve their periodicity. Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analyses identify 5 optimal lag features (representing wind power production from 1 to 5 hours ago), which are added to capture temporal dependencies. All numeric features are then scaled using MinMax normalization to ensure model stability.
Four regression models, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained using the time-series-aware cross-validation strategy (TimeSeriesSplit). Hyperparameter tuning is performed via grid search within each fold to identify the best-performing configuration. XGBoost emerged as the most accurate model based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics. The selected model is then retrained across all cross-validation folds using its optimal parameters, confirming its robustness through consistent error metrics.
Further, a binary classification metric (accuracy) is introduced by thresholding the predicted values, demonstrating strong model reliability with an accuracy score of 94.36%. Finally, forecasted production values are visually compared with actual observations using time series plots, providing clear interpretability and testing of model performance. The results confirm that combining autoregressive lag structures, engineered time features, and ensemble machine learning models offers a scalable and interpretable solution for high-resolution energy forecasting.
